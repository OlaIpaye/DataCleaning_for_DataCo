## Datasets (Before) and (After) Cleaning

**Working with RAW DATA(B):**

The first thing I did with the DataCo raw data (including txt and csv files) I was given was to open them inidividually in Excel then I imported each sepeted files in the main "Orders" file so they can all be in one worksheet.

Then I removed the formating from each of them by removing the initial table designs and converted the tables to normal cell ranges. After, I renamed each file in the worksheet.

**Working with RAW DATA(A):**

Once all the initial 3 files I was given to clean are in one worksheet, I decide to: format the headings by making it bold with a yellow background color so it stands out from the rest of the cells in the worksheet. Then I added filters to each column headings, and adjusted the column widths so that all cell content is visible.
