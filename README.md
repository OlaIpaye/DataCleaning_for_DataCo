## Datasets (Before) and (After) Cleaning

**Working with RAW DATA:**

The first thing I did with the DataCo raw data (including txt and csv files) I was given was to open them inidividually in Excel then I imported each sepeted files in the main "Orders" file so they can all be in one worksheet.

Then I removed the formating from each of them by removing the initial table designs and converted the tables to normal cell ranges. After, I renamed each file in the worksheet.
